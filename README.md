# Krypt_Watermark

Krypt_Watermark offers a fully customisable watermark for your server. It includes both text and image options.

## Installation

1. Download latest [release](https://github.com/ExpiredMilk244/Krypt_Watermark/releases).
2. Drag the `Krypt_Watermark` folder into your FiveM server's resources folder.
3. Add the following line to your server.cfg file:

```
start Krypt_Watermark
```

## Configuration

You can edit all options in the `settings.lua` file to your liking.

To change the image, navigate to the `html` folder in the resource, and replace `image.png` with your image (MUST BE IN PNG FORMAT). For better results, use a transparent background with a size of 300-400px.

Note that the image must be named `image.png` for it to work.

To make changes to the image's size and position, edit the `style.css`.
